## User Experience (UX) 

- ### Customer Focus
  1. The player needs to be able to easily navigate the site to find the game controls and buttons.
  2. The player needs to be able to easily find the information about the remaining time after pressing start.
  3. The visitor needs to be shown a clear message about the outcome.
  4. The visitor needs to be able to see the points scored.

- ### Design
  - #### Color Scheme
    - The color scheme is based on the painting of "Tjost" by JÃ¶rg Breu the Younger for Paulus Hector Mair
      <h3><img src="assets/images/screenshots/paulus_hector_mair_tjost_fig2.jpg" height="213" width="512"></h3>

  - #### Typography
    - The 'Germania One' set up the tone of old german / old English
    - As only a few instructions are given and the font is readable and clean, only this font is used on the site

  - #### Imagery
    - Imagery is important, hence there is the main stage on which animated pictures will underline the countdown, making the game more interactive
    - the skills are displayed by pictures to make it clearer and easier to use

- ### Wireframe
  - Main Page Wireframe - [View](/workspace/Jousting/assets/jousting.bmpr)

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" button on the menu.
    - Alternatively, click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrosDe/Jousting
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AndrosDe/Jousting
